- I'm using `autodoc2` to create the API documentation. This is a fork of the
  original `autodoc` extension that allows you to use Markdown in your docstrings.
  You can read more about it [here](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
  The differences between this and the original `autodoc` are documented [here](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodoc_diff.html).
